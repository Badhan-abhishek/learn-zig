# learn zig

Learning zig and logging my progress here.

I will try to do something daily in this repo

This will not be a project but multiple files with different things I learned or tried.

NOTE: No AI will be used (Copilot etc)

Editor used: [Neovim btw](https://github.com/badhan-abhishek/nvimdot)
